#### Ingredients
 - [ ] 1x (12-oz) bag egg noodles
 - [ ] 1.5 cups vegetable stock
 - [ ] 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
 - [ ] 3.5 tablespoons flour
 - [ ] Butter
 - [ ] (1x) yellow onion, medium, halved and sliced thinly
 - [ ] (4x) cloves garlic, minced
 - [ ] (16 oz) button or cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thickly
 - [ ] (0.5 cup) dry white wine
 - [ ] Leaves from 3 sprigs thyme, minced
 - [ ] Ground black pepper
 - [ ] (0.5 c) full-fat Greek yogurt / sour cream
 - [ ] Black pepper + salt for seasoning




#### Method
1. Cook egg noodles just past al dente, ~10 min when started from hard-boiling water. Drain, rinse briefly, and set aside for later serving
2. Meanwhile, form sauce base: whisk together vegetable stock, Worcestershire sauce, and flour; then, set aside for later saucing
3. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a large sautee pan over high heat. As foaming subsides, add onions, toss to coat with fat, and cover. Sweat on low heat until translucent, ~10 min
4. Remove cover, add 2 tbsp butter, garlic and mushrooms, and toss to combine. Sautee on high heat with tossing, until mushrooms have absorbed the fat and developed some browning, ~5 min
5. Add wine to deglaze, scrape fond into solution with a wooden spoon, and let simmer on high heat uncovered until reduced slightly, ~3 min
6. Add sauce base from step 2 to the pan, stir to coat, then add thyme and black pepper to taste, stirring again to coat. Simmer uncovered on high heat with occasional stirring until thickened, ~5 min
7. Dot yogurt / sour cream on top of the sauce mixture and simmer to the desired consistency. Remove from heat, adjust seasoning with black pepper + salt, and serve over cooked egg noodles
