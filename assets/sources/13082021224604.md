# Quiche Lorraine
#### Tags
["light"]

#### Ingredients
 - [ ] 1 prefabbed pie crust
 - [ ] 6 ounces bacon (preferably mild smoked), cut crosswise in 1/4-inch strips
 - [ ] 1 tablespoon butter
 - [ ] 3 eggs
 - [ ] 11/4 cups heavy cream
 - [ ] 1/4 pound gruyere cheese, grated
 - [ ] Salt
 - [ ] Pepper
 - [ ] Pinch nutmeg



#### Method
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Roll out the dough and line a buttered 10-inch tart pan, bringing the edges of the pastry up to extend slightly beyond the edge.
3. Top the dough with parchment paper. Fill it with dried beans as a weight. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until just golden brown. Remove the beans (they can be reused for this purpose) and discard the parchment paper. Reduce the oven heat to 325 degrees.

4. Blanch the bacon for 5 minutes in boiling water, remove, and pat dry. Then sauteÃÅ the bacon over low heat with the butter. Spread the bacon and the grated cheese in the prebaked tart.
5. In a bowl, beat the eggs lightly and mix in the cream. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg and pour this mixture gently over the bacon and cheese.
6. Bake the quiche for about 30 minutes, or until the filling is golden brown and set.
7. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving warm.
