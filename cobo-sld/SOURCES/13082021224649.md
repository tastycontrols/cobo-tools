 - [ ] 2 tbsp butter
 - [ ] 2 large onions sliced thinly
 - [ ] 5-6 medium cremini mushrooms, sliced thinly
 - [ ] (1x. large russet potato, sliced into 1/4" rounds
 - [ ] 4 tbsp creme fraiche (can substitute sour cream)
 - [ ] 1 tbsp fresh thyme
 - [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
 - [ ] Beaten egg (for pastry wash)




#### Ingredients
1. Preheat oven to 375F. Steam potatoes until just starting to tenderize (i.e., a fork pierces easily). Set aside to cool
2. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a pan on medium-high. Sautee onions until caramelized, stirring frequently
3. Remove onions to a mixing bowl. Add creme fraiche, thyme, and salt, and toss to combine
4. Add 1 tbsp butter to the pan, and sautee the mushrooms until fat has been absorbed. Fold into the onion mixture
5. Unroll pie crusts onto parchment paper. Place potato rounds in a 6" circle on the center of the crusts
6. Spoon the onion mixture on top of the potatoes, spreading evenly. Fold the bare edges of the dough over the filling, giving the galette five or six edges
7. Apply the egg wash to the pastry, and drizzle the remaining egg on the filling. Bake for 35-45 minutes until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling slightly
8. Cool 10-15 minutes before serving. To make a substantial meal, top slices with an over-easy or sunny egg, with runny yolk
