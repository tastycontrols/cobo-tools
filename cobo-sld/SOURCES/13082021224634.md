#### Notes
Abstracted from this recipe: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/07/ham-and-swiss-quiche-sunday-brunch-recipe.html

If using >2 fillings, reduce amount of cheese used. Cheese may settle to surface and solidify as a layer during baking, giving a false positive on the jiggle-test

#### Ingredients
 - [ ] 1x prefabbed pastry crust
 - [ ] Fillings, e.g.:
  - [ ] Bacon or ham
  - [ ] Asparagus
  - [ ] Potatoes
  - [ ] Leeks, shallots or onions
 - [ ] 4 eggs
 - [ ] 1 cup milk
 - [ ] 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
 - [ ] 1 tbsp Dijon or spicy brown mustard
 - [ ] Salt + pepper
 - [ ] 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese (Gruyere, Emmental, Jarlsberg, &c)

#### Method
1. Unroll pastry crust, press into Pyrex pie dish, and chill. Preheat oven to 350 degF

2. Prepare fillings. For examples listed:
    Ham: dice (1x) 0.5 oz ham steak and brown briefly in 1 tbsp butter. Cool before filling pastry
    Bacon: dice 4x rashers bacon and render out grease, covered with water. Brown uncovered and strain off bacon, reserving grease for downstream use. Cool before filling pastry
    Asparagus: drop 4x sprigs bias-cut asparagus into boiling, salted water. Boil 1 min, then crash-cool on iced water. Cool and drain before filling pastry
    Potatoes: lightly boil 1x diced russet potato in salted water, 10 min. Drain and cool before filling pastry
    Leeks, shallots or onions: sautee briefly in butter or bacon grease, then sweat ~10 min. Cool before filling pastry

3. Just before assembly, whisk together the custard: eggs, milk, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, salt and pepper.

4. Layer fillings into prepared pie dish, then sprinkle with cheese. Evenly pour over custard mixture

5. Bake, 350 degF, 30-40 min. Check at 30 min for surface browning and a positive jiggly-test: center of quiche should jiggle slightly if pan is agitated. If surface is still too fluid, continue baking until set, checking every 5 min

6. When done, remove quiche from oven and rest 20 min before serving
